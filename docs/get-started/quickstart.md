# Quickstart

This guide walks you through installing NemoClaw, creating a sandboxed OpenClaw instance, and running your first agent prompt.

## Prerequisites

You need the following prerequisites to get started:

- Node.js 20 or later
- Docker or [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)
- [OpenShell CLI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/releases) installed and on your `PATH`
- NVIDIA API Key from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com) for cloud inference

## Install NemoClaw

Install NemoClaw from npm:

```console
$ npm install -g nemoclaw
```

Or install from source:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/openshell-openclaw-plugin.git
$ cd openshell-openclaw-plugin
$ sudo npm install -g .
```

Test the installation:

```console
$ nemoclaw --help
```

This should display the help message for the NemoClaw CLI.

## Run Setup

Run the setup command to create an OpenShell gateway, register inference providers, and launch the sandbox by running:

```console
$ nemoclaw setup
```

The first run prompts for your NVIDIA API Key and saves it to `~/.nemoclaw/credentials.json`.
Setup creates an OpenShell gateway, registers inference providers, and launches the sandbox.

## Connect to the Sandbox

Connect to the sandbox by running:

```console
$ nemoclaw <sandbox-name> connect
```

This opens an interactive shell inside the sandboxed OpenClaw environment.

## Run an Agent

Inside the sandbox, start an OpenClaw agent session:

```console
$ openclaw agent --agent main --local -m "your prompt" --session-id s1
```

## Switch Inference Providers

NemoClaw supports three inference profiles.
Switch between them with the OpenShell CLI:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} NVIDIA Cloud

```console
$ openshell inference set --provider nvidia-nim --model nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Local vLLM

```console
$ openshell inference set --provider vllm-local --model nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Local NIM

```console
$ openshell inference set --provider nim-local --model nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
```

:::

::::

Refer to [Inference Profiles](../reference/inference-profiles.md) for full details on each provider.

For host-backed local inference such as vLLM or Ollama, OpenShell reaches the host through `host.openshell.internal`, not `localhost`. Bind the host service to `0.0.0.0` so the gateway can reach it. On Linux hosts that use UFW, allow the local inference port from the Docker bridge subnet before switching providers.

## Monitor the Sandbox

Open the OpenShell TUI to monitor sandbox activity and approve network egress requests:

```console
$ openshell term
```

When the agent tries to access an endpoint not in the baseline policy, the TUI prompts you to approve or deny the request in real time.

## Deploy to a Cloud VM

To run on a remote GPU instance through [Brev](https://brev.nvidia.com):

```console
$ nemoclaw deploy my-gpu-box
```

Then connect remotely:

```console
$ nemoclaw deploy my-gpu-box
```
